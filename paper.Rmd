# Introduction
The goal of this project is to replicate and extend the Monte Carlo simulation study described in the article:

*A Comparison of Green, Delta, and Monte Carlo Methods to Select an Optimal Approach for Calculating the 95% Confidence Interval of the Population-Attributable Fraction.*

This study evaluates three methods for constructing confidence intervals for the Population-Attributable Fraction:

- Green method  
- Delta method  
- Monte Carlo method  
# Methods

# Results
Plots from the simulation will be included here.
