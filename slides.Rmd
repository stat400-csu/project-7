## Introduction


- $PAF$ - Population Attributable Fraction
- $RR$ - Relative Risk
- $P_e$ - proportion of the popualtion exposed
  
- PAF Formula: 
\[
PAF = \frac{P_e(RR-1)}{P_e(RR-1)+1}
\]

## CI Methods

- Delta Method
- Greenland Method
- Monte Carlo

## Project Outline

- Replicate scenario from *A Comparison of Green, Delta, and Monte Carlo Methods to Select an Optimal Approach for Calculating the 95% Confidence Interval of the Population-Attributable Fraction.* by Lee et al.

- Compare:
  - PAF estimates
  - CI width
  - Coverage Probability
  - How often CIs leave the our "valid range" of [0,1]
